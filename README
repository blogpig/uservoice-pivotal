UserVoice-Pivotal v1.0


UserVoice-Pivotal is an Uservoice (http://uservoice.com) integration
script for Pivotal Tracker (http://www.pivotaltracker.com).


[ PREREQUISITES ]

* PHP5
* PHP/cURL


[ INSTALLATION ]

Just clone the repository into a directory on your web server and you're
almost ready to go :)

  cd ~/public_html/
  git clone git@github.com:blogpig/uservoice-pivotal.git
  cd uservoice-pivotal
  copy config.sample.php config.php


[ CONFIGURATION ]

Edit the "config.php" and enter your UserVoice info and credentials.

Here's a brief description of the settings you need to configure.

* USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN

Your UserVoice subdomain, e.g. for 'http://yoursubdomain.uservoice.com',
enter just 'yoursubdomain' in this field.

* USERVOICE_KEY & USERVOICE_SECRET

On UserVoice Dashboard, go to Seetting > Channels and scroll down to the
API section. Click the 'Add API Client' button to create a new API
client. Copy the 'Key' and 'Secret' params and paste them into
USERVOICE_KEY and USERVOICE_SECRET.

* USERVOICE_ADMIN_EMAIL & USERVOICE_ADMIN_PASSWORD

Your email and password for logging into the UserVoice Admin area. You
can also create dedicated UserVoice Admin for Pivotal integration.

* USERVOICE_SITE_URL

This is by default your UserVoice site URL (e.g. 'http://yoursubdomain.uservoice.com'),
but can also be e.g. 'http://support.yourdomain.com' if you use a custom
Feedback Site (top of the Settings > Channels page).

* USERVOICE_IMPORT_FORUMS

Imports all forums by default ('all'), but can be configured to import
none ('none') or just a few (e.g. '12345,12678' will import suggetions
from forums with IDs 12345 and 12678 only).

Additional filtering can be configured by using category and/or forum 
params for Pivotal Import API URL (see PIVOTAL TRACKER CONFIGURATION below).

* USERVOICE_IMPORT_TICKETS

Again, imports all tickets by default ('all'), can be turned off ('none')
and can also be configured to import just tickets having a certain
custom field and value (e.g. 'Type=Bug' will import just tickets with
the value of custom field Type set to Bug)

Additionaly, if you want to add a dynamic filter for each Pivotal project
you can set it to e.g. 'Product=%product_name%' - this uses the URL param 
'product_name' and import just tickets having that value for custom field
'Product' (see PIVOTAL TRACKER CONFIGURATION below).

* USERVOICE_UPDATE_FORUMS & USERVOICE_UPDATE_TICKETS

Set these to 'all' if you want suggestion & ticket statuses in UserVoice
updated when story statuses are updated in Pivotal.

* LOG_ERRORS, LOG_IMPORTS & LOG_HOOKS

The script will write errors to the log file by default, but you can
enable both hook and import requst logging by setting the values of the
LOG_ERRORS, LOG_IMPORTS and LOG_HOOKS params.

Make sure the LOGS_PATH (e.g. public_html/uservoice-pivotal/logs/) is
writable by the web server.


[ SECURITY ]

In order to protect the import script, configure basic authentication
for the 'import.php' file. You can use the htaccess.sample file as a
template.

[ PIVOTAL TRACKER CONFIGURATION ]

Go the the Project Integrations page for your project.

* Activity Web Hook

Link the hook to the hook.php script on your site, e.g. 
http://yourdomain.com/uservoice-pivotal/hook.php

* External Tool Integrations

In the "Create New Integration" dropdown select "Other" and fill the
following params:

  Name: UserVoice
  Base URL: http://yourdomain.com/uservoice-pivotal/base.php/
  Import API URL: http://yourdomain.com/uservoice-pivotal/import.php

The import script also accepts a 'category' param if you want to filter
the suggestions being imported, e.g.

  http://yourdomain.com/uservoice-pivotal/import.php?category=YourProduct

Other supported params include 'forum' (expects the ID of your UserVoice 
forum) and any defined custom fields (see USERVOICE_IMPORT_FORUMS and 
USERVOICE_IMPORT_TICKETS above), e.g.

  http://yourdomain.com/uservoice-pivotal/import.php?forum=123456
  http://yourdomain.com/uservoice-pivotal/import.php?product_name=YourProduct

You will also want to protect your import script with basic auth:

  Basic Auth Username: [username from the .htaccess/.htpasswd file]
  Basic Auth Password: [password from the .htaccess/.htpasswd file]


[ CONCLUSION ]

That should be enough to get you going :) Comments & suggestions are
most welcome :)
